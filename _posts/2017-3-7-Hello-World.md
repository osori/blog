I have just created my blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), one of static pages generator that are popular to hackers these days. Compared to conventional blog makers like WordPress, this seems to be much simpler because I don't have to configure database and other tedious stuff--it's only what I write that matters here. I chose Jekyll also because it was developed with Ruby which I got interested in recently. 

Most of all, it is very light and took only minutes for me to make this decent, responsive blog. Now I am very saddened to think about the amount of time and efforts I put into my buggy personal website ([http://ilkyu.kr](http://ilkyu.kr)). ðŸ˜­

I will be keep posting how slothy I am doing in my life, some projects that I'm working on, and daily photos of my poos to keep track of my health.
