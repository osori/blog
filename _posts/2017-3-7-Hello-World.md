I have just created my blog using Jekyll, one of static pages generator that are popular these days. Compared to conventional blog makers like WordPress, this seems to be much simpler because I don't have to configure database and other tedious stuff--it's only what I write that matters here. I chose Jekyll also because it was developed with Ruby which I got interested in recently. 

I will post how slothy I am doing in my life, some projects that I'm working on, and daily photos of my poos to keep track of my health.
